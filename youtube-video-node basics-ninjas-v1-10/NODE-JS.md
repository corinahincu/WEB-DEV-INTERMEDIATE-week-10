* when we write in javascript, we need to find a way to be converted into machine code, for its to understand what we want to do. So node js itself is written in C++, but as a program it allows also to write js, which can roll on a computer or server. The reason that node js is written in C++, is because it uses v8 js engine created by google, which is also written in C++. V8 js engine converts js to be understood by computer or server.
